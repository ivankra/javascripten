> Narcissus is a meta-circular JavaScript interpreter with a very
> direct representation of values: primitives are self-representing,
> objects are represented as objects (with their properties accessible via
> usual property access), and functions are represented as functions. The
> interpreter is designed this way to allow existing JavaScript functions
> and objects (such as the standard libraries) to interface directly
> with Narcissus code without following any special protocol or requiring
> wrapping and unwrapping.
