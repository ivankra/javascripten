## History

Succeeded by a newer engine in Microsoft Edge (Legacy) - which originally also kept Chakra name (chakra.dll),
later open-sourced as [ChakraCore](chakracore.md).

Still used in Windows as `jscript9legacy.dll` - Windows 11 24H2 replaced
classic [JScript](jscript.md) with Chakra-based JScript9Legacy engine.
